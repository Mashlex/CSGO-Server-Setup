# CSGO-Server-Setup
This Git provides some configs for an extended [CSGO Egg](https://github.com/Mashlex/Pterodactyl-Eggs/blob/199753a61b2bc9f04b5c4e3f6ecd1fea73615fb2/egg-counter--strike--global-offensive.json), which can be found in another Git. These files are missing from the standard CSGO server, so they are loaded additionally.

The core of this Git is the Admin Menu Custom Config, as well as the gamemode_server.cfg files. Thanks to Sourcemod, complete configurations and customizable parameters can be loaded into this menu, making it easy for players with rights to start the mode with their preferences without needing knowledge of the CSGO server's syntax. To make full use of the menu, you should add the [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2919873317) Maps to the server. Without it, certain maps cannot be loaded.

Additionally, the package contains some useful plugins and configurations that can be copied directly to a server, provided that [Metamod](https://www.sourcemm.net/) and [Sourcemod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) are installed.

## Configs 
### Server Config
The server.cfg is the core of the server configs. It contains all the basic settings that are important.
### Gamemodes Configs
The gamemode configs are only links to the existing files. This makes it easy if these files are updated by Valve. Some configs have additional commands that may fix some errors. These are not affected by the Valve updates.
### Gamesettings Configs
These are the config files which can be loaded via the admin menu and which merge the functions of the plugins with the gamemodes. They are also reset again and again through this.
### Mappool INC
These are mappools, very close to the default pools. But they can be easily adapted as desired.
### Adminmenu
The standard "Adminmenu.smx" is edited. The menu items that are normally present have been removed and inserted as required.
### Adminmenu Custom
This file contains the extra gamesetting configurations with the queries for some individual commands. The game mode can be started via the admin menu and adjusted again and again without having to know anything about the source syntax.
### Botprofile
The bug with the rank not being available bothered me. That's why the console no longer shows it. Maybe Valve will fix it one day or HL3 will be released.
